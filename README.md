# Hello there, thank you for checking out my GitHub page.

Here you can get my personal projects and those that I can share (most of the projects that I am most proud of are not here).

## I've been coding since 2014

I started with Wordpress (HTML and CSS, not PHP) and some JavaScript while working as a graphic designer and studying arts at the Central University of Venezuela.

Later (2017) I started internships in a technology company, during the first months I learned the basics of Python and deepened my knowledge of JavaScript. In this company I grew a lot as a developer using mainly Angular, Ionic, Jekyll and Django.

## TypeScript is one of my strengths

Today I am pretty good at TypeScript frameworks like Angular and NestJs, I've also worked with Flutter, React and Kotlin and in my spare time C# and Java while playing in Unity.

I have twice implemented Micro Frontends architectures using Single SPA, and I'm used to working with Microservices for the backend, continuous integration for testing and deployments and very basic Kafka for complex flows between various microservices.
